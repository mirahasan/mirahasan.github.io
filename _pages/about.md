I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) at Austin Peay State University. I am passionate about teaching, and love teaching courses in programming, databases, web and mobile application development, software engineering, and  cybersecurity.

My research interests encompass the areas of information retrieval, search engines and recommender systems, expert search, and search for educational support. My focuse is on developing and evaluating new technologies for educational support leveraging the techniques available in those Ô¨Åelds. My work resulted in publications in top venues, such as IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), Hawaii International Conference on System (HICSS), ACM/SIGIR International Conference on Research & Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), and IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE).
